# Nonlinear-Finite-Element-Code-for-3D-Hyperelastic-Problem
A program showcasing the process of solving a 3D hyperelastic problem in an 8-node cubic element using the Newton-Raphson method
Two cases are presented: tension and shear. Various stress, strain, tangent components are plotted in addition to the residual log.

## Description of the problem
The code solves the problem having the following energy function: 
$ U \left( J^e \right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \kappa $
